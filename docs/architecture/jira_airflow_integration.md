# JIRA and Airflow Integration

Use this document to note integration points between JIRA workflows and Airflow runs.

## Ideas
- Track DAG execution status in JIRA tickets for high-priority sources.
- Automate comment updates when DAGs succeed or fail.

Add concrete steps and scripts as integrations are implemented.
