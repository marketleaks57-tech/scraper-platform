# Migration Notes

- Track remaining gaps for v5.0: orchestrator decision, browser engine implementation or deprecation, and dependency hardening.
- Ensure pipeline definitions stay compatible by supporting both `agent` and `name` keys during transition.
- Update production readiness and validation documents after each migration step to keep audit trails current.
