# Linux Deployment Notes

Guidance for deploying the scraper platform on Linux environments. Detailed steps are in `../DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Quick pointers
- Ensure Python 3.11+ and required optional dependencies are installed.
- Use `docker-compose.yml` for local orchestration when possible.
- Configure environment variables for database connections and API secrets before running Airflow.

Add distro-specific notes here when issues arise.
