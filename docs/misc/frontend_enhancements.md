# Frontend Enhancements

Use this file to track planned and completed improvements to the dashboard in `../frontend-dashboard/`. It was relocated from `frontend-dashboard/FRONTEND_ENHANCEMENTS.md` as part of the documentation consolidation.

## Ideas
- Document API dependencies and expected payloads.
- Capture UX feedback and future roadmap items.
