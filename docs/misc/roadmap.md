# Roadmap

- Expand dashboard capabilities (API documentation, UX improvements) based on feedback captured during runs.
- Finalize browser automation support or formally disable the placeholders to reduce operational risk.
- Continue migrating configurations to the canonical orchestrator while maintaining compatibility during transition.
- Enhance observability: richer error codes, dashboard alerts, and database export health checks.
- Integrate CI/CD and ticketing hooks (DeepAgent, JIRA/Airflow) where required for governance.
