# v4.8 Requirements

Legacy release checkpoints retained for reference:
- Resolve P0 blockers captured in historical notes (connectivity, schema alignment, and DAG stability).
- Track P1/P2 fixes to ensure scraper outputs meet minimum quality thresholds.
- Document any applied patches and regression coverage before upgrading to the v5 series.
