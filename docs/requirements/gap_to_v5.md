# Gap to v5.0

Use this document to track remaining work required to align with the v5.0 target.

## Known items
- Formalize decision on canonical agent orchestrator (legacy vs. pipeline pack).
- Implement browser engines in `src/pipeline_pack/engines/` or disable them explicitly in configs.
- Harden optional dependency handling for database and browser features.

Adjust this list as priorities change.
